# Parking Slot Booking System - Enhanced Features Implementation

## Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced Booking Summary (✅ Complete)
- **Start and End Time Display**: The booking summary now shows separate start time and end time instead of just a time range
- **Duration Information**: Clear display of total booking duration in hours
- **Selected Slots Count**: Shows how many time slots are selected
- **Prorated Pricing Alerts**: Visual indicators when pricing adjustments are applied

**Implementation Location**: 
- `src/pages/user/BookingPage.tsx` - Updated booking summary sections in payment, upload, and success steps
- Enhanced selected slots summary in time selection step

### 2. Consecutive Time Slot Enforcement (✅ Complete)
- **Validation Logic**: Users can only select consecutive (adjacent) time slots
- **User Feedback**: Alert message shown when attempting to select non-consecutive slots
- **Slot Management**: Automatic validation ensures only valid consecutive combinations are allowed

**Implementation Location**:
- `src/pages/user/BookingPage.tsx` - Added `areConsecutiveSlots()` function and enhanced `toggleSlot()` logic

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
function areConsecutiveSlots(slots: string[]): boolean
function toggleSlot(slotStart: string)
```

### 3. 30-Minute Minimum Booking with Prorated Pricing (✅ Complete)
- **Minimum Time Requirement**: Slots can only be booked if more than 30 minutes remain **until the end of the time slot**
- **End-Time Based Calculation**: The 30-minute rule is calculated from the slot's end time, not start time
- **Example**: If it's 00:15 and you're in slot 00:00-01:00, there are 45 minutes until 01:00 ends, so booking is allowed
- **Prorated Pricing**: Partial slots are priced based on remaining time until slot ends with 50% minimum
- **Visual Indicators**: Orange "$" badge on slots with prorated pricing
- **Price Calculation**: Dynamic pricing based on actual time remaining until slot completion

**Implementation Location**:
- `src/pages/user/BookingPage.tsx` - Added pricing calculation functions
- `src/components/TimeSlotAvailability.tsx` - Added minimum time validation and visual states

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
function hasMinimumTime(slotStart: string): boolean
function getRemainingTimeInSlot(slotStart: string): number
function calculateSlotPrice(slotStart: string): number
```

## Visual Enhancements

### Time Slot Status Colors
- **Blue**: Available slots (normal pricing)
- **Yellow**: Limited availability
- **Red**: Full/unavailable
- **Gray**: Past slots or insufficient time remaining
- **Orange Badge ($)**: Prorated pricing applied

### User Interface Improvements
- **Booking Rules Panel**: Clear explanation of booking rules and pricing
- **Prorated Pricing Details**: Breakdown showing adjusted prices for partial slots
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Clear feedback for invalid selections
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Proper display on all device sizes

## Technical Details

### Pricing Logic
```typescript
// Calculate remaining time until slot END
const slotEndDateTime = new Date(slotStartDateTime.getTime() + 60 * 60 * 1000);
const remainingMs = slotEndDateTime.getTime() - now.getTime();
const remainingMinutes = Math.floor(remainingMs / (1000 * 60));

// Pricing rules:
if (remainingMinutes >= 60) {
  return spot.price; // Full price (e.g., $20)
} else if (remainingMinutes >= 30) {
  // Half price + proportional extra
  const halfPrice = spot.price * 0.5; // $10
  const extraMinutes = remainingMinutes - 30; // Minutes above 30
  const extraPrice = (extraMinutes / 30) * (spot.price * 0.5); // Proportional
  return halfPrice + extraPrice;
} else {
  return 0; // Cannot book
}
```

### Validation Rules
1. Only consecutive time slots can be selected
2. Slots must have >30 minutes remaining **until the slot ends**
3. Prorated pricing applies to partial slots (calculated from remaining time until slot completion)
4. Minimum 50% of base price guaranteed

### Real-time Updates
- Slot availability updates in real-time via Supabase subscriptions
- Dynamic pricing calculation based on current time
- Automatic disabling of slots with insufficient time

## Usage Guidelines

### For Users
1. Select consecutive time slots only
2. Slots with "$" badge have adjusted pricing
3. Gray slots cannot be booked (past or <30 min remaining)
4. Check booking summary for detailed pricing breakdown

### For Developers
- All pricing logic is centralized in `calculateSlotPrice()`
- Slot validation is handled in `areConsecutiveSlots()`
- Visual states are managed in `TimeSlotAvailability` component
- Real-time updates are handled by `useSlotAvailability` hook

## Testing Considerations

### Test Cases
1. **Consecutive Slot Selection**: Verify only adjacent slots can be selected
2. **30-Minute Rule**: Ensure slots close to current time are disabled
3. **Prorated Pricing**: Verify correct price calculation for partial slots
4. **Mobile Display**: Test slot selection on mobile devices
5. **Real-time Updates**: Verify live availability updates

### Edge Cases
- Slots spanning midnight
- Rapid slot selection/deselection
- Network interruptions during real-time updates
- Multiple users booking simultaneously

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Bulk Pricing Discounts**: Volume discounts for longer bookings
2. **Peak Hour Pricing**: Dynamic pricing based on demand
3. **Cancellation Policy**: Partial refunds for early cancellations
4. **Advanced Booking**: Extended future booking capabilities
5. **Recurring Bookings**: Weekly/monthly booking patterns
